        <h1>Welcome to Commonroom!</h1>
        <p>
          Each chat here is a transient journey, echoing the ephemeral nature of
          hostel common rooms. Our platform offers a space for serendipitous and
          fleeting group connections.
        </p>

        <p>
          As you begin making anonymous friends on Commonroom, we ask that you
          navigate with respect and consideration. In this shared space, we
          uphold a few simple rules to ensure that everyone enjoys their time in
          our rooms:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Acceptance of Terms:</strong> By accessing or using
            Commonroom, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions. If
            you do not agree with any part of these terms, please do not use our
            platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>User Conduct:</strong> We believe in the power of respectful
            and positive interactions. Any form of harassment, hate speech, or
            disrespectful behavior will not be tolerated.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Age Requirement:</strong> Users must be 18 years or older to

          <li>
            <strong>Content Guidelines:</strong> Share content that is
            appropriate and respectful. Any content deemed offensive, harmful,
            or inappropriate will be removed, and may result in an IP ban.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Embark on your Commonroom adventure with an open heart and a curious
          mind. Happy chatting!
